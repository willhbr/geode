# Geode

Additional functionality for Crystal.

Geode is opinionated by design and does not shy away from changing stdlib behaviour.

## Installation

1. Add the dependency to your `shard.yml`:

   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     geode:
       github: willhbr/geode
   ```

2. Run `shards install`

## Usage

Either require everything:

```crystal
require "geode"
```

Or require just one feature, eg:

```crystal
require "geode/log"
```
